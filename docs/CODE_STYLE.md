# Code Style

Conventions for contributors. Link to a specific rule from code review when needed.

## Naming

- View file names: `kebab-case` (e.g. `add-confidant-person.blade.php`).
- Language keys: `snake_case`.

## Livewire

Public properties of a Livewire component must be **primitive types only** (`string`,`int`, `bool`, `float`, `array`) 
— and enums are allowed. Do **not** type a public property as an Eloquent model.

**Correct:**

```php
public int $carePlanId;
public string $status;
public CarePlanStatus $status; // enum is fine
```

**Not this:**

```php
public CarePlan $carePlan; // Eloquent model as a public property
```

Resolve the model from its id inside the component method that needs it instead.

## Blade + Alpine.js

When an Alpine.js expression spans multiple lines inside a Blade attribute, indent the expression body one level
**deeper** than the element's attributes, and align the closing `"` with the attribute block. Do not leave the body at 
the element's own indentation level.

**Correct** — the expression body is indented deeper, closing `"` aligned:

```html
<button @click.prevent="
            openModal = true;
            newAction = true;
            modalAction = new Action();
        "
        class="item-add my-5"
>
    {{ __('forms.add') }}
</button>
```

**Not this** — the body is under-indented and hard to scan:

```html
<button @click.prevent="
    openModal = true;
    newAction = true;
    modalAction = new Action();
"
class="item-add my-5"
>
    {{ __('forms.add') }}
</button>
```

## Multi-line tag attributes

When an element's attributes are split across multiple lines:

- Put each attribute on its **own line**, starting on the line after the opening tag; indent them one level deeper than the tag.
- Put the closing `>` on its own line (aligned with the opening tag), not appended to the last attribute.

**Correct** — each attribute on its own line, closing `>` on its own line:

```html
<div
    x-show="open"
    x-cloak
    x-ref="panel"
    x-transition.origin.top.left
    @click.outside="close($refs.button)"
    :id="$id('dropdown-button')"
>
```

**Not this** — first attribute kept on the tag line:

```html
<div x-show="open"
     x-cloak
     x-ref="panel"
     x-transition.origin.top.left
     @click.outside="close($refs.button)"
     :id="$id('dropdown-button')"
>
```

**Not this** — closing `>` glued to the last attribute:

```html
<div class="record-inner-value text-[16px]"
     x-text="`${ action.code } - ${ dictionary[action.code] }`"></div>
```
